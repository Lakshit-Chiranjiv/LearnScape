## 💡 Inspiration -
Going through the CNCF landscape and getting started with contributions gets overwhelming. We wanted to simplify the existing landscape for beginners and added a roadmap too for folks who want to learn more in the field of DevOps. 

This platform is developed such that it can guide new folks and learn concepts such as Docker and Kubernetes even if they contribute to this project because of the tools used in this project such as Docker, Datree, Alan AI, Firebase and Twilio. 

## ⚙ What it does -
- Simplified CNCF LandScape where you can filter, search projects to contribute according to your tech stack
- Get your questions answered about DevOps by Alan AI
- Get your own personalised roadmap to reach your goal of DevOps
- Twilio will alert the project admins if there occurs any error in the server and server is about to shut down
